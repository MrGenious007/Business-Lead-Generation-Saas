# AI Engine

## Overview

LeadPilot AI is positioned to use AI capabilities for business insights, growth recommendations, and automated marketing guidance.

The repository includes a placeholder package at `packages/ai-engine`, but there is no full implementation yet. This document defines the intended AI engine scope and architecture.

## Current Status

- `packages/ai-engine/src/index.ts` exists as a package stub.
- No actual AI prompt, model call, or report generation logic is implemented.
- The root app includes UI expectations for AI reports and recommendations, but they are not wired to a backend service.

## Intended Capabilities

### AI Business Consultant

- Analyze an organization's growth signals and recommend next-best actions.
- Provide business model suggestions based on industry and local data.
- Surface prioritized marketing, sales, and operations improvements.

### AI Marketing Consultant

- Audit campaigns and outreach workflows.
- Suggest message templates for email, WhatsApp, and SMS.
- Recommend audience segmentation and timing strategies.

### AI SEO Consultant

- Review website and local SEO signals.
- Offer improvements for Google Business Profile, keywords, content, and backlinks.
- Provide score-based diagnostics for local search visibility.

### CRM Assistant

- Summarize lead status and deal health.
- Suggest follow-up actions for stalled opportunities.
- Draft notes and proposal summaries for sales reps.

### Automated Report Generator

- Generate PDF-ready business reports and growth plans.
- Provide insights across leads, revenue, campaign performance, and customer activity.

## Architecture

### Inputs

- Organization data
- CRM records (leads, deals, tasks, notes)
- Marketing performance metrics
- Lead discovery activity
- Business profile and location data

### Processing

- Use OpenAI API to generate text-based analysis and recommendations.
- Use a prompt-engineered system that includes:
  - organization profile
  - recent CRM activity
  - campaign performance
  - business discovery findings

### Outputs

- Structured reports
- Insight cards
- Suggested action items
- Generated templates for outreach

## Integration Points

- AI should be a backend service with server-side API access to OpenAI.
- The UI should request AI-generated content via API routes or server actions.
- No private API keys should be exposed to the browser.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

- Avoid sending full PII datasets to the AI model unless necessary.
- Use data minimization and aggregation where possible.
- Clear user consent should be part of any analytics/AI report flow.

## Recommended Implementation Plan

1. Add a typed AI engine service in `packages/ai-engine` or `services/ai-engine`.
2. Implement secure OpenAI client initialization using environment variables.
3. Create a `POST /api/ai/reports` endpoint to generate insights.
4. Add an `AI Reports` page or dashboard widget surface.
5. Add caching for generated reports to reduce repeated model calls.
6. Add user-facing prompts and feedback mechanisms.

## Next Steps

- Build a first proof-of-concept report generator for lead and deal health.
- Extend the AI engine to produce marketing automation templates.
- Add AI-driven recommendations to the dashboard and CRM workspace.
