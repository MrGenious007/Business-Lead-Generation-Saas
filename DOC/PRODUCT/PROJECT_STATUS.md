# LeadPilot AI Project Status

## Current State

LeadPilot AI now has a stable single-app Next.js foundation with Supabase SSR authentication, multi-tenant organization context, server-side RBAC checks, hardened tenant schema migrations, and default route protection for authenticated application areas.

## Completed Work

- WI-001: Repository cleanup and structure consolidation completed.
- WI-002: Next.js App Router foundation stabilized with valid route files, middleware, and config.
- WI-003: Supabase authentication completed for login, signup, forgot password, reset password, logout, session recovery, and session persistence.
- WI-004: Multi-tenant organization foundation completed with profiles, memberships, settings, active organization persistence, and switching.
- WI-005: RBAC completed with shared permission definitions, server-side permission guards, and tenant-aware route protection.
- WI-006: Database foundation completed with migrations for tenant tables, invitations, indexes, audit fields, soft delete, and RLS policies.
- WI-007: Shared foundation types completed for API results, auth models, user/session models, and organization domain types.
- WI-008: Shared service consolidation completed for auth, user/profile, organization context, and permission lookups.
- WI-009: Route protection completed for dashboard, CRM, leads, organizations, nested settings pages, and future authenticated routes through default-protected middleware classification.
- WI-202: CRM types and validation completed with full TypeScript models, Zod schemas, DTOs, shared constants, form integration, and validation tests.

## Active Application Surface

- Public routes:
  - `/`
  - `/login`
  - `/signup`
  - `/forgot-password`
  - `/reset-password`
- Authenticated routes:
  - `/dashboard`
  - `/crm`
  - `/leads`
  - `/organizations`
  - `/organizations/members`
  - `/organizations/settings`
- API routes:
  - `POST /api/auth/logout`

## Implemented Foundations

### Authentication

- Supabase browser and server clients are implemented in `lib/supabase`.
- Server auth helpers enforce redirects for protected pages.
- `AuthSessionSync` handles recovery links and App Router refresh behavior.
- Logout is implemented server-side via `POST /api/auth/logout`.

### Multi-tenant Organizations

- `profiles` are linked to `auth.users`.
- Organization access is derived from `organization_members`.
- `profiles.active_organization_id` persists active tenant context.
- Organization settings and member management are wired to the active organization context.

### RBAC and Route Protection

- Shared permissions are defined in `lib/rbac.ts`.
- Server-side permission enforcement is implemented in `lib/rbac/server.ts`.
- Middleware protects all non-public application routes by default.
- Unauthorized users are redirected to `/login` with a `redirectTo` query param.
- Authenticated users without tenant permission are redirected to `/organizations` from protected organization subroutes.

### Services and Types

- Shared services now centralize auth, user/profile, organization, and permission logic.
- Shared result and domain types remove ad hoc response shapes and broad `any` usage from the foundation layer.

## Remaining Gaps

- Build and test validation still depend on local terminal reliability; editor diagnostics are currently clean, but full command execution must remain part of release validation.
- CRM types, validation, and forms are now aligned with the database schema; detail pages, search/filter, pipelines, and activity logging remain to be implemented.
- Lead discovery remains a functional foundation rather than a production-complete workflow.
- API coverage is intentionally thin; most behavior is still expressed through typed service modules rather than a broad route layer.
- Invitation acceptance, email delivery, and richer tenant administration flows remain incomplete.

## Feature Progress

- Authentication: 95%
- Organization support: 90%
- Roles and permissions: 90%
- Route protection: 95%
- CRM foundation: 75%
- Lead discovery: 50%
- Documentation and architecture alignment: 80%

## Overall Completion

- Estimated overall completion: 75%

The current codebase is build-oriented and internally consistent across auth, multi-tenancy, RBAC, and route protection. Remaining work is primarily product expansion, broader API coverage, and end-to-end validation in a reliable local runtime.
