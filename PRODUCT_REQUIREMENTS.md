## Detailed Requirements

### Business Requirement

Marketing Managers need a fast way to find local businesses in Delhi, filter them by industry and keyword, and bring them into the CRM for outreach. The feature must fit into the multi-tenant architecture and preserve organization data boundaries.

### Architecture

- Use a server-side lead discovery service to hide API keys and enforce tenant scope.
- Keep search input and result UI in the root app.
- Use shared authentication and organization context to determine the current tenant.

### Database

- Add a `businesses` table to store discovered leads.
- Add a `lead_search_history` table to store saved query filters.
- Include organization scoping fields such as `organization_id`.

### API

- `POST /api/lead-discovery/search`
- `POST /api/lead-discovery/businesses`
- `GET /api/lead-discovery/history`

### UI

- Lead discovery page with a search form and result grid.
- Controls for industry, keyword, city/state/country, radius.
- Result cards with import actions.
- Pagination controls and export button.

### Sprint Plan

- Define types and validation for lead search.
- Implement backend service for search and persistence.
- Build frontend search page using existing dashboard shell and forms.
- Add duplicate detection and import safeguards.
- Add export support for results.

### Testing

- Unit tests for validation and duplicate detection.
- Integration tests for search request and import flow.
- End-to-end tests covering authenticated access and org isolation.

### Documentation

- Update `README.md` with lead discovery feature notes.
- Document API endpoints in `API_SPEC.md`.
- Capture behavior in `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Notes

This product requirement focuses solely on the lead discovery feature within the scope of the current stabilization and foundation work. It is intentionally scoped to preserve tenant isolation, authentication, and core functionality without expanding into AI or marketing automation.
